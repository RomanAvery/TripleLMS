## About Plus Education


Plus School is a  Learning Management System, I believe that course development should be fun and creative. Plus School eliminates the hassle of creating online courses, through an intuitive and consistent interface.

Being based on <a href='https://nova.laravel.com'>Laravel Nova<a>, it is ideal to be used by other developers as a base project for other custom solutions.
